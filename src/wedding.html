          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p><b>How did we meet? </b>We met in 2013 at Home Depot (where we both work) when Rick moved back to Atlanta from Austin, TX. We had a holiday party at work and he and didn't know very many people at the Atlanta office. We went to Jazz (something) and ended up at the same table. We quickly became friends and chatted for most of the event. After that we hung out a few times, but were in different places in life so just remained friends. After a few years of grabbing lunch together or just chatting in the hallway Rick asked if I would like to go to a comedy show at The Vortex. From that point on we have pretty much been inseparable.</p>
          <p><b>How did he propose? </b>We planned a weekend trip with some friends to Lake Burton where Rick’s family has a house. He had mentioned several times that he wanted to take a sunset cruise on the boat with everyone. I didn’t really think anything of it we did that often with groups of people. However, the weather was gloomy, and it was not really possible to see the sunset, so I was surprised when he said he still wanted to take the boat out. We rode around the lake for about 30 minutes or so just kind of cruising. We were going slowly through a small cove and our song started playing. He stopped the boat, turned to me, got on one knee and proposed. Only one other person on the boat knew he was going to do that, so it was a surprise to everyone. After I said yes, he pulled out a bottle of Dom Perignon that he had been hiding and we all had champagne.</p>
